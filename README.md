- 👋 Hi, I’m @Reeck208
- 👀 I’m interested in Life! Yea, all of it!
- I have a Ph.D. in Biomolecules and have developed unique aptamers and antibodies to use as probes in assays I have also developed.
-  Additionally, I have edited genomes in stem cells and zebrafish to learn about biomolecule fuctions. All this work was "wet" lab work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computational biology for Spatial Omics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Spatial Omics projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me : Reeck208@gmail.com
